# py_movingTiles


Problem Statement


Sherlock is given 2 square tiles, initially both of whose sides have length L placed in an x - y plane; 
so that the left bottom of each square coincides with the the origin and their sides are parallel to the axes. 

At t = 0, both squares start moving along line y = x (along the positive x and y) with velocities S1 and S2. 

For each query of form Qi, Sherlock has to report the time at which the overlapping area of tiles is equal to Qi. 


Note: Assume all values are in standard units. 

Input Format 
 First line contains integers L, S1, S2. Next line contains Q, the number of queries. Each of the next Q lines 
 consists of one integer Qi in one line.

Constraints 
 1 <= L, S1, S2 <= 10**9
 1 <= Q <= 10**5
 1 <= Qi <= L**2
 S1 != S2

Output Format 
 For each query, print the required answer in one line. Your answer will be considered correct if it is at 
 most 0.0001 away from the true answer. See the explanation for more details.

Sample Input 
10 1 2
2
50
100


Sample Output 
4.1421
0.0000


Explanation 

For the first case, note that the answer is around 4.1421356237..., so any of the following will be accepted: 
4.1421356237
4.14214
4.14215000
4.1421
4.1422
